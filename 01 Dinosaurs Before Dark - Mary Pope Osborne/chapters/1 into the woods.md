# **Into the Woods** 

“Help! A monster!” said Annie. 

“Yeah, sure,” said Jack. “A real monster in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.” “Run, Jack!” said Annie, She ran up the road, 

“救命!一个怪物!”安妮说。“当然，”杰克说。“在宾夕法尼亚州青蛙溪的一个真正的怪物。“跑,杰克!安妮说，她跑到路上，



Oh, brother. 

This is what he got for spending time with his seven-year-old sister, Annie loved pretend stuff. But Jack was eight and a half. He liked *real* things.“Watch out, Jack! The monster’s coming! Race you!” “No, thanks,” said  Jack. 

哦,哥哥。

这是他和他七岁的妹妹安妮在一起时得到的，她喜欢假装的东西。但杰克已经八岁半了。他喜欢“真实”的东西。“小心,杰克!怪物来了!比赛你!“不，谢谢，”杰克说。



Annie raced alone into the woods. 

Jack looked at the sky. The sun was about to set. 

“Come on, Annie! It’s time to go home!” 

But Annie had disappeared. 

Jack waited. 

No Annie. 

安妮独自跑进了树林。

杰克看了看天空。太阳就要落山了。

“来吧,安妮!该回家了!”

但是安妮不见了。

杰克等。

没有安妮。



“Annie!” he shouted again. 

“Jack! Jack! Come here!” 

Jack groaned. “This better be good,” he said. 

Jack left the road and headed into the woods. The trees were lit with a golden 

late-afternoon light. 

“Come here!” called Annie. 

“安妮!
他又喊道。

“杰克!
杰克!
到这里来!”

杰克呻吟着。
“最好是好的，”他说。

杰克离开大路，走进树林。
树上闪耀着金色的光

傍晚时分光。

“到这儿来!
“叫安妮。



There she was. Standing under a tall oak tree. “Look,” she said. She was 

pointing at a rope ladder. 

The longest rope ladder Jack had ever seen. 

她是。站在一棵高大的橡树下。“看,”她说。她是

指着绳梯。

这是杰克见过的最长的绳梯。



“Wow,” he whispered. 

The ladder went all the way up to the top of the tree. 

There—at the top—was a tree house. It was tucked between two branches. 

“That must be the highest tree house in the world,” said Annie.“Who built it?” asked Jack. “I’ve never seen it before.” 

“I don’t know. But I’m going up,” said Annie. 

“No. We don’t know who it belongs to," said Jack. 

“Just for a teeny minute,” said Annie. She started up the ladder. “Annie, come back!” 

“哇,”他低声说。

梯子一直爬到树顶。

那儿——在顶部有一个树屋。
它夹在两根树枝之间。

“那一定是世界上最高的树屋了，”安妮说。
“是谁造的?
”杰克问。
“我以前从来没见过。”

“我不知道。
但是我要上去，”安妮说。

“没有。
我们不知道它是谁的，”杰克说。

“就一分钟，”安妮说。
她开始爬上梯子。
“安妮,回来!”



She kept climbing.Jack sighed. “Annie, it’s almost dark. We have to go home.” 

Annie disappeared inside the tree house. 

“An-nie!” 

Jack waited a moment. He was about to call again when Annie poked her head out of the tree house window. 

“Books!” she shouted. 

“What?” 

“It’s filled with books!" 

Oh, man! Jack loved books. 

He pushed his glasses into place. He gripped the sides of the rope ladder, and up he went

她一直攀升。
杰克叹了口气。
“安妮，天快黑了。
我们得回家了。”

安妮消失在树屋里。

“An-nie !”

杰克等了一会儿。
他正要再打一次电话，这时安妮从树屋的窗户里探出头来。

“书!
”她喊道。

“什么?”

“里面装满了书!”

哦,男人!
杰克爱书。

他把眼镜戴好。
他抓住绳梯的两侧，爬了上去
